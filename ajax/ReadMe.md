# Ajax
    Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

    It is an approach to using a number of existing technologies together. (HTML, XHTML, CSS, JS, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object.)

    Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
    Update a web page without reloading the page
    Send data to a web server - in the background

## JSON

## XMLHttpRequest
    XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.
    
## URL
    protocol - https
    domain name - www.w3schools.com
    port - 5500
    path of the file - /myhtml.html
    parameters - 
    anchor

## Absolute URL vs Relative URL

## HTTP request methods
    GET : only retrieve data.
    POST : submits an entity to the specified resource
    PUT : replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
    DELETE : deletes the specified resource.
    resource - Entites / Users
